## 📘 Introduction

OrderTime is a Django-based restaurant order management system that allows restaurants to manage customer orders efficiently. It enables selecting menu items, adjusting quantities, placing orders, and viewing or deleting orders in real time. The system uses Django templates with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and stores data in memory without a database, making it suitable for learning and demonstration purposes.
